  "description": "PROBLEMManaging multiple RAG AI agents can be complex when each has its own purpose andvector database. * Manually tracking agents and deciding which one to query wastes time. * LLMs often struggle to determine which agent best fits a user’s request.THIS WORKFLOW ENABLES AUTOMATED MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION, DYNAMICALLY SELECTINGAND QUERYING THE CORRECT AGENT USING CONTEXTUAL AI QUERY TOOL AND GEMINI 2.5FLASH.HOW IT WORKS * A form trigger allows users to create new agents by specifying a name, description, datastore, and uploading files. * A new agent is created with the provided information and files are ingested in the datastore * We get the status of file ingestion every 30 seconds until the ingestion process is complete * When users send queries, the Agent Orchestrator identifies the most relevant agent to generate grounded, context-aware responses.Note: The document ingestion process is asynchronous and may take a few minutesbefore your agent has the document fully available in the datastore forquerying.HOW TO SET UP * Create a free Contextual AI account [https://app.contextual.ai/] and obtain your CONTEXTUALAI_API_KEY. * Add CONTEXTUALAI_API_KEY as an environment variable in n8n. * For the baseline model, we have used Gemini 2.5 Flash Model, you can find your Gemini API key here [https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key]HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE WORKFLOW * Replace the Form Trigger with a Webhook Trigger or manual input to integrate with custom systems. * Swap Gemini 2.5 Flash with another LLM provider * Update the wait time as per user requirement * Modify the system prompt to fine-tune how the orchestration logic selects and queries agents. * You can check out this Contextual AI API reference [https://docs.contextual.ai/api-reference/agents/create-agent] for more details on agent creation and usage. * If you have feedback or need support, please email [email protected] [/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee888b8b8a8c8f8d85ae8d81809a8b969a9b8f82c08f87].",

  "summary": "Effortlessly manage and orchestrate multiple RAG AI agents, each with unique data sources and purposes.  \nUsers create new agents via a simple form, specifying details and uploading relevant files, with real-time feedback on ingestion status.  \nWhen queries are submitted, the system intelligently selects the most suitable agent using Contextual AI’s query tool and Gemini 2.5 Flash for precise, context-aware answers.  \nEasily customize triggers, models, ingestion timing, and orchestration logic to fit your workflow needs—all supported by robust integration guides and responsive support.",
